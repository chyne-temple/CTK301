    <h2>About us </h2>

    <p>My name is Chyne Temple. I am a CTK student from Evanston, Illinois that attends ISU as a sophomore in college. This is my first year taking this class as well as experiencing and learning all of the basics to creating and designing webpages. Most of the examples on this website are replicas or creations of my own that had to be done in class at ISU.

    What makes me and my work important?

    Showing the examples of my work, it not only opens me up for anyone who needs someone to design a website but also shows the progression that I have had in my work when coming to web design, especially because I started this semester.
